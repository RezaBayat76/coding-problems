Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.

Input: "Hello"
Output: "hello"

Note: Most languages support lowercase conversion for a string data type. However, that is certainly not the purpose of the problem. Think about how the implementation of the lowercase function call can be done easily.
